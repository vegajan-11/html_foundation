      <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3> 
 
      <p> 
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. 
      </p> 
 
      <p> 
       <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      </p> 

      <p>
The <strong>ECMAScript standard</strong> does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.     </p>

     <p>
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
     </p>

     <p>
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
     </p>


  <h3>Website Client-side Usage </h3> 
 
      <p> 
       JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the 
DOM. 
      </p> 

  <p> 
       All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device. 
      </p> 

  
      <p>Examples of Scripted Behavior </p> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.
        </li> 
        <li>
Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them. 
        </li> 
        <li>
Playing browser games.
        </li> 
        <li>
Controlling the playback of streaming media.
        </li> 
        <li>
Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes. 
        </li> 
        <li>
Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.
        </li> 
        <li>
Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use 
this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.
        </li> 
        <li>
Redirecting a user to another page.
        </li> 
        <li>
Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards. 
        </li> 

        
      </ul> 
 

      <h3>Web Libraries and Frameworks </h3> 
 
      <p> 
<strong>React</strong> (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
     </p> 
 <p> 
     <strong>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong>. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary 
rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
     </p> 


      <h3>Angular</h3> 
 
      <p> 
    <strong>Angular</strong> (also referred to as "Angular 2+")  is a <strong>TypeScript-based</strong>, free and open-source single-page web 
application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and 
corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
     </p> 


      <h3>jQuery </h3> 
 
      <p> 
   In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. While still 
in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.
     </p> 

    <h3>Vanilla JS</h3> 
 
      <p> 
  The framework-like moniker "<strong>Vanilla JS</strong>" is term that has been coined for websites not using any libraries 
or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
