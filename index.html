        <strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is the most basic building block of the Web. 
It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally 
used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). 
      </p> 
 
      <p> 
        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or 
between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and 
linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. 
      </p> 
 
      <h3>What is HTML?</h3> 
 
      <p> 
        HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext<strong>M</strong>arkup 
<strong>L</strong>anguage. It is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML 
consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to 
make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The <em>enclosing</em> tags can make a word or 
image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  
      </p> 
 
      <p> 
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: 
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand 
        HTML and render HTML code as websites. 
      </p> 
 
      <p>The Main Parts of Elements are as Follows</p> 
 
      <ol> 
        <li>The opening tag</li> 
        <li>The closing tag</li> 
        <li>The content</li> 
        <li>The element</li> 
      </ol>
